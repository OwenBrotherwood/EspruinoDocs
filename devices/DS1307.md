DS1307 RTC
=========

* KEYWORDS: Module,RTC,Real Time Clock,Clock,Time,Date

**Note:** Espruino contains its own RTC - see [[Clocks]]. However if you need a battery backed-up RTC with full calendar functionality then this may be a better solution.

The DS1307 RTC chip is used in a few off the shelf modules.

Tested against a nRF52-DK with an Arduino Data Logging Shield

The following reads from the RTC module and prints the date and time in a string to the console every second.

```Javascript
I2C1.setup({scl:B6,sda:B7});
var rtc = require("DS1307").connect(I2C1);
setInterval(function() {
  console.log(rtc.readDateTime());
}, 1000);
```

To set the day.  The day is required so that the clocks move forwards and backwards for daylight saving in the UK.
Please note that you need to call the readDateTime function at least every second for this to work.

```Javascript
rtc.setDow("day of the week")
```

To set the date:

```Javascript
rtc.setDate(date,month,year);
```

To set the time:

```Javascript
rtc.setTime(hours,minutes);
```
